## Recommended Development setup

You will need the following things properly installed on your computer.

* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
* [.NET 9.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0) 
* [Docker Desktop]()

You should also be familiar with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) which we use for this project. This helps give you more guidance as you code from [intellisense](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense) when using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).


We recommend the following tools for your dev setup:

* Editor: [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* Terminal: [Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal-preview/9n0dx20hk701?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) or [hyper](https://hyper.is/)

Additionally, when you open the project in VS Code, you'll be prompted to install recommended extensions.

### Development

Set the `NODE_BIN` environment variable, `.vscode/launch.json` for VS code and `apps\pwabuilder\Properties\launchSettings.json` for Visual Studio:
- Windows: `C:/Program Files/nodejs/node.exe`
- Mac: `/usr/local/bin/node`
- Linux: `/usr/bin/node`

Using VS Code (App and API)
- Run `VSCode Run and Debug` (F5 key) to build the project and start a local Edge browser.
- Closing the Edge browser will terminate the debug session.

Using Visual Studio (API only)
- Open the solution and run the `https` profile (F5 key)

Alternatively, build the `Dockerfile.production` container and access it from `http://localhost:8080`
