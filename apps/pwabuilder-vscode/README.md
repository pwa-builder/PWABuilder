PWA Studio makes VSCode the BEST developer environment for building Progressive Web Apps. Using it, you can:

* Start building a brand new PWA using the [pwa-starter](https://aka.ms/pwa-starter) template
* Convert an existing web app into a PWA
* Audit your PWA to ensure it is app store ready and installable!
* Publish your PWA to the web using [Azure Static Web Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/static/)
* Package your PWA for the Microsoft, Google, and Apple App Stores
* Generate a Service Worker so that your PWA works offline
* Generate ALL the correct sized Icons for a PWA
* Use our snippets to upgrade the user experience of your PWA

[Our documentation](https://docs.pwabuilder.com/#/studio/quick-start) contains all the info you need for working with the extension, including tutorials and more!
